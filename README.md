The goal of a **state space model** is to infer information about the state variables of a dynamic system, given the observations. The algorithm for carrying out this procedure is the Kalman Filter.

An excerpt from my book:

The state space representation of a timeseries problem is a sequential analysis framework that typically includes tasks like filtering and smoothing.
Refer to the **code directory** of this repo to find out more.
